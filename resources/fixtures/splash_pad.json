This group covers an area of 370 square leagues, and it is formed of sixty groups of islands, among which the Gambier group is remarkable, over which France exercises sway. These are coral islands, slowly raised, but continuous, created by the daily work of polypi.

The reefs were still numerous, but more equalised, and marked on the chart with extreme precision. The Nautilus easily avoided the breakers of Money to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard, placed at 130° long. and on the 10th parallel, which we strictly followed.\n\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:32 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\nOn the 13th of January, Captain Nemo arrived in the Sea of Timor, and recognised the island of that name in 122° long.\n\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:32 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\nFrom this point the direction of the Nautilus inclined towards the south-west. Her head was set for the Indian Ocean. Where would the fancy of Captain Nemo carry us next? Would he return to the coast of Asia or would he approach again the shores of Europe? Improbable conjectures both, to a man who fled from inhabited continents. Then would he descend to the south? Was he going to double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and finally go as far as the Antarctic pole? Would he come back at last to the Pacific, where his Nautilus could sail free and independently? Time would show.\n\nUpdated on Wednesday, September 26th, 2018 @ 12:32 PM by Captain Nemo (captain):\nAfter having skirted the sands of Cartier, of Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott, last efforts of the solid against the liquid element, on the 14th of January we lost sight of land altogether.
