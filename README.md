The **N**anoFab **E**quipment **M**anagement & **O**perations (NEMO) web application is laboratory logistics software that strives to be intuitive and easy to use, making life easier in the lab. NEMO manages tool reservations, control access to tools, and streamline logistics and communication. The code is open source and free so that other labs can benefit.

Documentation for NEMO resides in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki).

If you're interested in deploying NEMO at your organization, there are [deployment considerations](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki/Deployment-considerations) documented in the wiki. This covers what infrastructure you will need in order to have a robust production-level deployment. The [installation guide](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki/Installation-guide) provides a step-by-step guide to deploying NEMO on a Linux server. NIST is working on making NEMO easier to deploy (on Windows, Linux, Docker, and more).

The [community page](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki/Community) outlines how to ask questions and contribute to NEMO. Bugs can be reported to the [issues page](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/issues). If you've found a security issue with NEMO then please read our [security policy](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki/Security-policy) and tell us discretely.
