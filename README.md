NEMO is a laboratory management web application that strives to be intuitive and easy to use, making life easier in the lab. NEMO manages tool reservations, control access to tools, and streamline logistics and communication. The source code is open source and free so that other labs can benefit.

If you're interested in deploying NEMO at your organization, there are [deployment considerations](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki/Deployment-considerations) documented in the wiki. This covers what infrastructure you will need in order to have a robust production-level deployment. The [installation guide](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki/Installation-guide) provides a step-by-step guide to deploying NEMO on a Linux server. NIST is working on making NEMO easier to deploy (on Windows, Linux, Docker, and more).

We welcome pull requests. Bugs can be reported to the [issues page](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/issues). If you've found a security issue with NEMO then please read our [security policy](https://github.com/usnistgov/NEMO/wiki/Security-policy) and tell us discretely.
